# Re-enable warning 35 for line length (default is 72, we override below)
# The actual line length is controlled by the ChkTeX source, but we can
# use a workaround by setting it in the environment

# Note: ChkTeX's line length check (warning 35) is typically set to 72 by default
# To change it to 125, you may need to suppress this warning and use editor rulers instead
# or recompile ChkTeX with different defaults
